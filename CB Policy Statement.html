The Committee judges that risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance.\nHowever, the economic outlook remains uncertain, and the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks. We will continue to monitor incoming information and are prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.\nThe Committee will also continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans."

                name: "European Central Bank (ECB)",
                statement: "The Governing Council today decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates unchanged. Incoming information has broadly confirmed our previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook. Inflation is expected to decline further over the remainder of the year as the impact of past upward shocks fades and tight financing conditions weigh on demand.\nWe are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. Based on our current assessment, we consider that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to this goal.\nOur future decisions will ensure that policy rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary."

            BOJ: {
                name: "Bank of Japan (BoJ)",
                statement: "At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Bank of Japan decided to maintain the current monetary easing measures. The Bank will continue with Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.\nJapan's economy has recovered moderately, although some weakness has been seen in part. With extremely high uncertainties surrounding economies and financial markets at home and abroad, the Bank will patiently continue with monetary easing while nimbly responding to developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions.\nThe Bank expects a virtuous cycle between wages and prices to intensify."
            },
            BOE: {
                name: "Bank of England (BoE)",
                statement: "The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework.\nThe Committee has judged that monetary policy needs to remain restrictive for an extended period of time to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. The MPC will continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including the tightness of labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and services price inflation.\nFurther tightening in monetary policy would be required if there were evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures."

            BI: {
                name: "Bank Indonesia (BI)",
                statement: "Bank Indonesia's Board of Governors Meeting decided on 23rd and 24th May 2025 to hold the BI 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate at 6.25%, while also maintaining the Deposit Facility (DF) rates at 5.50% and Lending Facility (LF) rates at 7.00%.\nThis decision is consistent with the pro-stability monetary policy stance, which is a pre-emptive and forward-looking measure to ensure inflation remains within the 2.5±1% target in 2025 and 2026. The policy focus is directed at strengthening rupiah exchange rate stability from the impact of global uncertainty.\nBank Indonesia will continue to optimize its mix of monetary, macroprudential, and payment system policies to maintain stability and support sustainable economic growth amid persistently high global financial market uncertainty."
